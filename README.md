JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

The purpose of this project was to create a dynamic table based on UFO sighting data that allows users to filter the data for specific values. Only JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js was used. 


### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * A column was createed for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 

* Using multiple `input` tags and select dropdowns, I wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
